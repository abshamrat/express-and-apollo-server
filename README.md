## About Apollo Server
### What is Apollo Server?
Apollo Server is the best way to quickly build a production-ready, self-documenting API for GraphQL clients, using data from any source.
It’s open-source and works great as a stand-alone server, an addon to an existing Node.js HTTP server, or in “serverless” environments.
